captcha recognize project

label_pic.ipynb: used for orgnizing pictures and labeling.

image_processing.py: used fr processing image to get binary picture.

Captcha_tensorflow.py: used for build model and train binary picture by tensorflow's nn module

Captcha_tensorflow_keras.py: used for build model and train binary picture by tensorflow's keras omdule.

Recommend the Capthca_tensorflow_keras.py. It's mor intuitive and concise. 
But if you want to learn how the convolutional neural network is built, the Captcha_tensorflow is more origin
